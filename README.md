# FilmQueryProject

## Description

This project was to create a command-line application that retrieves and displays film data. It is a menu-based program allowing the user to choose actions and submit query data. The application was split into five classes and three packages. The "FilmQueryApp" housed our main method and handled launching and presenting the UI to the user. The "DataBaseAccessor" is an abstract class intended to increase the re-usability of the application in future JDBC applications. The "DatabaseAccessorObject" was the engine of this JDBC exercise and therefore contained all of the SQL code and database connections. The final two object classes laid the frame work for the focused queries of our user stories, finding films and their data as well as returning them and their cast as objects or collections of objects.

## Lessons Learned

The focus of project being Java Database Connectivity I was not expecting to find this application so easy to write. The only real slow down I ran into was adding and then printing a list of Actors with their film. In all honesty I believe the issue was more just myself not allowing myself to step away when I was clearly burnt out. Trying to push through to fininsh instead of giving myself time to step away and refocus.
